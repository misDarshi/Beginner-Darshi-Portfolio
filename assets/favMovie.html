        <h3>Portrait of a lady on fire</h3>
<p>“do all lovers feel theyre inventing something?”<br/>
My body is still visibly shaken, and i cried the entire duration. i haven’t been this moved by a film in years. not only is it exquisitely made, but the emotional toll it took on me is almost damaging. yearning personified: seen through the stokes of a paintbrush, or across the flames of a fire. crushing and beautiful and fleeting. sometimes all that’s left is the memory, but the memory stays. that last shot is going to haunt me.</p>
“not everything is fleeting. some feelings are deep”</P>
<p>I finally figured it out. many times when i watch a new favorite film, it adds something to my life, a new, additional piece of me. with this, it calmly settles down in a special empty space in my heart, an emptiness that’s been eagerly waiting for it to come along. it makes me feel more complete. going forward, i’m thankful i get to carry this with me now. it fits so naturally that it feels like it’s always been there, and now it always will be</p>
<h3>Barfi</h3>
<p>There's an odd musical number about how the movie is about to start, and then a serious note about cancer, and the movie begins and it's nice looking and quaint and sweet, and very soon we are realizing that this film was India's submission to the Oscars, was a mega-hit, and was considered controversial as it blatantly lifts scenes, themes, and scores from countless Western films. It feels classic rather than modern quirk. the unadulterated passionate filmmaking that is as playful and so full of genuine heart wins you over.<br/>
I hope I meet someone who won't leave my hand under a falling lamp post.</p>
<h3>Begin Again</h3>
<p>You can tell a lot about a person by what's on their playlist.<BR/>
Walking around the city and just listening to someone's favourite songs on their CD player and getting to know them through music totally sounds like my ideal first date.<br/>It's the type of film that leaves the best kind of feeling in the end and that stays forever, I not the kind of person that likes movies because of the production, direction or any type of professional aspect, I’m more interested in the feeling and impact it leaves even after a long time. And this movie did this for me.</p>
